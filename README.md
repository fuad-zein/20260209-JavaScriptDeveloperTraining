## Free Weekend - Certified Mid Level JavaScript Developer Training

---

### **Serve the Website that the JavaScript Runs In:**

1. Using your IDE’s built-in terminal or your regular terminal at the challenge directory, install project dependencies with the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start up the local dev server with the following command:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Visit the url output in the terminal after running the command to see the site. (Usually [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) if that port isn’t already in use.)

4. That’s it! You can work in the project files like normal to meet the requirements of the challenge

### **Chapter 1: JavaScript Fundamentals**

<details>
<summary><strong>Intro to JavaScript</strong></summary>

- JavaScript is the programming language of the web browser and can also be found on web servers, IoT devices, and more.

- For this exam, you should be familiar with both the basics of JavaScript and more intermediate concepts. This chapter gives a refresher of the basics. If you are comfortable with the concepts in chapter 1 already, feel free to skip it.

- If you find yourself struggling through this chapter, consider starting with the level 1 exam instead of this one. You can find a link to it on the root training page of the dashboard.

<summary><strong>Basic Debugging</strong></summary>

- `console.log` is a simple tool for giving you visibility into your JavaScript code as it runs. It’s the easiest way to start seeing what’s going on with your code but it’s also a powerful debugging tool that experts use everyday. The console is where you’ll view messages logged by `console.log` as well as error messages thrown by JavaScript.

- During the exam, you should know simple issues you might face writing JavaScript and how you can fix those issues using the console and `console.log`.

<summary><strong>Variables and Data Types</strong></summary>

- Variables are like containers where you can store and label different types of information. That information can be a string of characters like those that makeup your name or a number that can be used in Math equations, like your age, or a variety of other types.

- During the exam you’ll need to know the various ways of declaring variables with let and const. You’ll also need to be familiar with primitive data types like strings, numbers, and booleans. Later on we’ll also discuss more complex types, like arrays and objects.

<summary><strong>Basic Operators</strong></summary>

- For the exam, you should know how to use operators to perform match operations and comparisons.

<summary><strong>Arrays</strong></summary>

- Arrays allow us to store lists of data. For example, a list of products to display on an e-commerce site or a list of news articles to browse through.

- For the exam, you should know the basics of working with arrays; things like: getting array length, adding new items to arrays, accessing an item at a specific index, removing items from arrays, and more.

- For this exam, you’ll also need to know advanced array methods but we’ll cover that in the Advanced Array and Object Methods chapter.

<summary><strong>Control Structures</strong></summary>

- Conditionals are how we give our code the ability to make decisions based on the values of our variables. Loops are useful for doing the same thing over and over again.

<summary><strong>Functions</strong></summary>

- Functions allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times.

- Learn the various syntaxes for defining functions, how to call functions, and how to make them flexible with artuments.
